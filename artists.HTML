        <p>Víctor Jara (1932-73) was a Chilean composer and folk singer and one of the forerunners of <i>nueva canción</i>. He "became a centre of political turmoil during the late 1960s and early ’70s" (Augustyn, 2023) as the New Song Movement gained traction in Chile. With Salvador Allende and the Popular Unity Party making a mark in Chilean politics, Víctor Jara gained even more importance as he performed his music for the Party. In 1973, General Augusto Pinochet organized a military coup that overthrew President Allende. A day after the coup, Víctor Jara was arrested with countless other socialist sympathizers, and on September 16, 1973, he was found dead and tortured. But his death was not in vain. His image remained with not only the Chileans but all of Latin America. Conversely, "his bravery in the face of death has made Jara a touchstone for politically committed artists." (Vila ed., 2014, 31) He became a national symbol in Chile, and his name appears in many popular songs even to this day.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In his music, Víctor Jara focuses on a call to action and unification of the people. One of his most famous songs was “Venceremos” or “We Will Overcome”. It was the anthem for leftists in Chile and became the theme song of Allende's campaign. Witnesses who last saw Víctor Jara claimed that when "he was beaten and taunted to sing... he responded with the first part of... “Venceremos” before being dragged off." (Villa ed., 2014 31)</p>

      <p>Violeta Parra (1917-67) was a Chilean composer and folk singer. She was an essential founder of <i>nueva canción</i> and spoke out on the social conditions of Chile. She traveled around Chile and played music for the masses. Violeta built the foundations for the <i>nueva canción</i> genre and worked with artists like Víctor Jara. She "inspired the young artist to join the movement" (Blau, 2024) and became a strong supporter of socialist President Salvador Allende. At age 49, she took her own life, but her impact on the Latin American movement had solidified and only grew. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Violeta Parra added a drastic change to Latin American music. She had created work "that spoke clearly to the times yet was rooted in rural tradition, forging a new style of performance and communication and changing the relationship between art and reality." (Kutschke and Norton eds., 2013, 131) Her song "La Carta" challenges the gruesome political realities of pre-Pinochet's dictatorship. Violetta confronts foreign investors draining the country's resources and "the militias [that] give them bullets" when "the hungry ask for bread". She also connects to the emotions of her people. Violeta embraces her passion through "Volver a los 17" and her feelings of grief and loss through "Run Run Se Fue Pal Norte". Her music spoke for the people and gave voice to those who would not have any otherwise.</p>

        <p>Mercedes Sosa (1935-2009) was a famous Argentine singer who became the voice of Argentina's El nuevo cancionero. She popularized many of the songs of composers like Silvio Rodríguez in the movement and performed all around Argentina. In 1976, with the rise of a dictatorship by Jorge Videla, Mercedes Sosa began to receive death threats. Despite this, she continued to stay in Argentina until 1979, when she was "searched and arrested on stage" (BBC, 2009) and banned from her own country. Sosa fled to Europe for three years but returned with a hero's welcome by the people. She continued to perform for the people and stood as the "Singer of the people" (Doyle, 2015, 555).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sosa's music had an underlying theme of political subjects. She would tap into "universal emotions, singing about stopping war and ending poverty, about finding love and losing loved ones." (TMCnet, 2007) She was also unafraid to criticize actors outside of Argentina. She "fused political poetry with regional and pan–Latin American and Caribbean rhythms... to sound trenchant critiques of and transnational solidarities against Western imperialism and racial capitalism." (Fischlin and Porter, 2021, 48)</p>
