        <p><i>Nueva canción</i> changed the landscape of music all across Latin America. The revival of folklore music and the movement became an integral part of the music in many states. According to Folkways, "Nueva cancioneros throughout the Americas today continue to sing out against." The music of the movement did not become a fleeting success. The genre has only grown since the 20th century, and its features have "remained unchanged throughout its development" (Gorlinski 2019).</p>  
        <br>
        <p>Moreover, because of its pan-Latin American effects, <i>nueva canción</i> led to musical exchanges between the Latin American states. Argentine singer Mercedes Sosa would sing "La Maza" by Cuban artist Silvio Rodríguez and "Gracias A La Vida" by Violeta Parra of Chile. In 1971, the Chilean group Quilapayún was invited to Cuba, and they worked directly with Fidel Castro to bring together young Cuban musicians to Chile. Famous Cuban singers Rodriguez and Milanés performed with "Victor Jara, Isabel and Angel Parra and others in a major event in Chile’s National Stadium" (Kutschke and Norton eds., 2013, 132). <i>Nueva canción</i> shattered the borders of music and unified the people of Latin America.</p>

        <p>Many <i>nueva canción</i> artists were exiled from their homelands with the rise of dictatorship across Latin America. The groups Inti Illimani and Quilpayún "were given homes by the local government in Rome and Paris respectively" (Kutschke and Norton eds., 2013, 133). In their new countries, they continued to tour and spread the ideologies of <i>nueva canción</i> within Europe. In the United States, "Activist-musicians Rafael Manríquez and Quique Cruz formed Grupo Raíz... to affirm and introduce Chilean <i>nueva canción</i> to the Bay Area and beyond." (Folkways, n.d.) In exile, musicians continued to attract big crowds and fanned the hopes and dreams of the movement.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Folklore music also became intertwined with different genres of music in the United States. Throughout the rock revolution in the United States, Folk-rock protest songs "enjoyed an immense popularity fueled by access to the mass media and the commercial music industry." (Tumas-Serna, 1992, 6)</p>
        <br>
            <h3 id = "3.3">Political Effects</h3>
            <p>Artists of the <i>nueva canción</i> movement made substantial contributions to global politics. Because of their connections back home, exiles became "crucial sources of information for the United Nations, nongovernmental organizations, and governments" (McSherry, 2017, 19). Chilean exiles continuously worked around the world and built organizations that "created an 'external front' that was crucial in the 'political war on the dictatorship'" (McSherry, 2017, 20).</p>
