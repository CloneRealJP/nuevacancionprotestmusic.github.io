            <h3 id = "1.1">Rise of Political Oppression</h3>

        <p>	From the 1950s to the 1970s, Latin America was struck with a rise in political and social unrest. 
          From the northern island of Cuba to the southern regions of Chile and Argentina, dictatorship began 
          to rise out of democratically elected states. Many countries were "saddled with ineffective or 
          authoritarian governments, and the gap between the wealthy and the impoverished was widening" 
          (Gorlinski, 2019). Social conditions began to crack under the burden, and within the turmoil, 
          resistance against political oppression began to emerge. The populace had banded together to form a 
          new social movement called <i>nueva canción</i>.</p>

        <h3 id = "1.2"><i>Nueva Canción</i></h3>
      <p>From Nueva Canción Chilena- New Chilean Music- to the Cuban Nueva Trova, <i>nueva canción</i> was a 
        pan-Latin American social movement. It started in the late 1950s and early 1960s to combat the rise 
        of dictatorship in Latin American states and highlights the people's struggle for social justice. It 
        became an "emblem of the socially, economically, and politically marginalized peoples of Latin 
        America" (Gorlinski, 2019). The people of the movement would put "their lives at risk opposing 
        authoritarian regimes and participating in rallies to support their political parties" 
        (Vila ed., 2014, 1).</p>

      <p>Moreover, <i>nueva canción</i> became an outlet for artists to express the population's collective 
        struggles with violent repression. The movement encompassed a diverse portfolio of music genres, 
        having no "blueprint or model that characterised the music that the individual singer-songwriters 
        and groups involved were making.” (Kutschke and Norton eds., 2013, 123) Yet despite the diversity, 
        the music of the movement had united the people. It inspired and motivated the people to a common 
        goal. The music "not only expressed the dreams and hopes of masses of people for progressive social 
        change but contributed to creating cultural and political change... and articulating the vision of a 
        different, socially just future." (McSherry, 2017, 13-14)</p>
        <br class = "pbreak">
        
      <p><i>Nueva canción</i> peaked with the inauguration of former Chilean president Salvador Allende. A 
        left-wing socialist, Allende had championed the New Song Movement and its goals. His election 
        "...was seen as a beacon of hope" (Folkways, n.d.). Even after Allende's election, "new song 
        musicians continued their unofficial, but active, involvement" (Morris, 1986, 121).</p>
        
        <br>
        <h3 id = "1.3">Musical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>The music of the movement holds deep roots in the rural native communities and folk music. An 
          increase in poor rural conditions caused mass urbanization across Latin America, primarily 
          delocalizing Native communities. They, in turn, brought "distinct musical traditions that students 
          and the middle class blended with other styles rooted in European culture" (Folkways, n.d.). The 
          new era of artists built off "Latin American folk traditions but with modern innovations." 
          (McSherry, 2017, 14) They experimented with their music and lyric styles by moving away from 
          adhering to only traditional instrumentation and rhythms. On the contrary, they began "toward the 
          inclusion of electronic instruments, classical harmonies, and jazz elements." (Morris, 1986, 126) 
          Lyrically, the movement's songs utilized a poetic style that "cried out for social justice, 
          equality, self-determination and structural change." (McSherry, 2017, 18) </p>
          <br class = "pbreak">
        <p>The artists of <i>nueva canción</i> expressed major societal themes through their music. They highlighted 
          "issues such as poverty, imperialism, democracy, human rights, and religious freedom." (Folkways, 
          n.d.) It called the people into action while denouncing the oppressive political acts of the 
          government. In many instances, artists had to bypass censorship within countries, which "led to the 
          development of highly poetic texts and complex metaphors." (Morris, 1986, 126)</p>
